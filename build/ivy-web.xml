<!--
    We better live with 2 netty versions (netty 3.6.6 for this) and netty 4.0 as our server base.
    Otherwise, async-http-client falls back to the JDK implementation which screws up big.
    <exclude name="netty" conf="compile" />

    As the netty guys had fun renaming each package and a bunch of classes anyway, there are not conflicts
    in doing so. Therefore DO NOT ENABLE the exclude above!
    async-http-client is used by Response#tunnel(...)
