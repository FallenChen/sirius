This application is using the SIRIUS framework. Use the sirius.sh script to
start or stop the application. Create a file named config.sh to override
the startup variables.

The application can be further configured by create a file named instance.conf
in the base directory (where this file is). Have a look at the main config
in app/application.conf or the module config (app/component-*.conf) but
never modify those, as all changes will be reverted by the next release. Use
the instance.conf to override or extend the configuration. This file has
precendence over all others.
