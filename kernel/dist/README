This application is using the SIRIUS framework. Use the sirius.sh script to
start or stop the application. Create a file named config.sh to override
the startup variables.

The application can be further configured by create a file named instance.conf
in the base directory (where this file is). Have a look at the main config
in app/application.conf or the module config (app/component-*.conf) but
never modify those, as all changes will be reverted by the next release. Use
the instance.conf to override or extend the configuration. This file has
precedence over all others.

To run the app as a different (non-root) user, specify the username in config.sh as USER_ID. You also might
wand to enable authbind (e.g. for port 80) by running:

cd /etc/authbind/byport
touch 80
chown USER:USER
chmod 700 80
