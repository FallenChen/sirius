sirius-search
====================

Provides a thin ORM layer above Elasticsearch which auto-creates mappings based on annotated entity classes.
Also provides a fluent API to create queries.

The module, as SIRIUS itself is currently only available as git submodule and not as maven dependency as it is under
heavy developement. Also, we distribute way more than a single jar, but a complete application environment. Finally
git submodules are quite easy to handle if you use the right tool ;-)
